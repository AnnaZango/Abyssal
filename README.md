## Description
It’s time to find love for Lily-The-Anglerfish. However, finding a partner in the abyssal waters where she lives is deemed as an impossible task. Will you be able to guide her through the dark and dangerous waters of the abyssal zone? Be careful: the further you go, the darker it gets…

## How to play
Move Lily by using the spacebar for thrust, and A and D keys to rotate backward and forward respecively. Be careful not to hit the walls!

## Development
This game was developed with Unity and C# during the participation in the course Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D, given by GameDev.tv Team on Udemy. Assets and animations for Lily were developed by me. Textures for the environment were provided within the course. Music and sound effects were taken from OpenGameArt. Fonts were downloaded from DaFont.
